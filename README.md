# Euclidean Sequencer

Euclidean sequencers divide a number of beat subdivisions over a time interval and place notes as evenly as possible into that time. They are based and take the name from the Euclidean algorithm, that computes the greatest common divisor of two given integers.The idea is very simple: repeatedly replace the larger of the two numbers by their difference until both are equal. This final number is then the greatest common divisor. That algorithm, given number n of time intervals, and another given number k < n of pulses, distributes the pulses as evenly as possible among these n intervals. 
Our software is a four voice euclidean sequencer implemented using the Javascript library React. It provides the user with the ability to create polymetries, polyrhythms and melodic arpeggios in a very intuitive and effective way. In fact, the user has at his disposal four circle lines, with which he can easily build his own patterns, modifying the number of intervals and pulses and their arrangement. To increase the expressive power and playability, he can also add some effects to the sequencer sounds, or act on the various channels to change the panning or individual volumes.

# Usage

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
