        <h2>But, what is an Euclidean Sequencer, anyway?</h2>
        <p>Euclidean sequencers divide a number of beat subdivisions over a time interval and place MIDI notes as evenly as possible into that time. This is a 4 voice euclidean sequencer for max for live. Creates complex polymeters and melodic arpeggios. Allows to have a fixed note per voice or create your own melodic sequence for each one.</p>
